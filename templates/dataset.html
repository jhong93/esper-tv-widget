  <h1>The Cable TV News Dataset</h1>

  <p>
The dataset available for analysis using Stanford Cable TV News Analyzer was provided by the Internet Archive's <a href="https://archive.org/details/tv">TV News Archive</a>. The dataset includes near 24-7 recordings of CNN, FOX, and MSNBC between January 1, 2010 and July 23, 2019. In total, the dataset consists of over 230,000 hours of video and includes both TV news programming and commercial segments.  
</p>
<p>
The Internet Archive provided the dataset as a collection of video files, with each video corresponding to one airing of a news program (e.g., most videos are approximately one hour in length). Per-video metadata includes the name of the news program, the date/time it aired, and the channel on which it aired. Video frames range in resolution from 640x360 to 858x480.  All videos include audio. 95.4% of the video files have accompanying closed caption transcripts. However, transcripts are not present during most commercial segments.

  From this source dataset, we also compute additional labels describing the video's contents as described on the <a href="/methodology">methodology page</a>.
