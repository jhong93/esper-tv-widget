  <h1>The Cable TV News Dataset</h1>

  <p>

  The dataset available for analysis using Stanford Cable TV News Analyzer was
  provided by the Internet Archive's <a href="https://archive.org/details/tv">TV
  News Archive</a>. The dataset includes near 24-7 recordings of CNN, Fox News, and
  MSNBC between {{ start_date }} and {{ end_date }}. (The dataset updates daily.)
  In total, the dataset consists of over {{ n_total_hours }} hours of video and
  includes both TV news programming and commercial segments.

  </p>

  <p>

  The Internet Archive's TV News Archive provided the dataset as a collection of
  video files, with each video corresponding to one airing of a news program
  (e.g., most videos are approximately one hour in length). Per-video metadata
  includes the name of the news program, the date/time it aired, and the channel
  on which it aired. Video frames range in resolution from 640x360 to 858x480.
  All videos include audio. {{ n_caption_percentage }}% of the video files have
  accompanying closed caption transcripts.

  </p>

  <p>

  From this source dataset, we also compute additional labels describing the
  video's contents as described on the <a href="/methodology">methodology
  page</a>.
