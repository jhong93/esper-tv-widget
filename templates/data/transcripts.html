    Searching the transcripts
  </h1>
  <p>
    For most of the videos in the data set, we have access to the transcripts.
    These have been time aligned at word granularity to the audio. You can
    search for video using transcripts with the
    <code>{{ search_keys.text }}="..."</code> predicate. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text }}="United Kingdom"</code> will find all
    times where the phrase "United Kingdom" is spoken. In its basic usage,
    the <code>{{ search_keys.text }}</code> filter accepts
    individual words and phrases, where a phrase is defined as an n-gram
    where all the words must appear in a sequence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This page describes some additional features of the transcript query
    language.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Listing words and phrases (word A or word B)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes a topic can be defined with multiple related or synonymous
    words/phrases. For example, the "European Union" can be also be referred to
    as the EU or E.U. in the transcripts. When this is the case, use the "|"
    character to delimit multiple words and phrases. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text}}="European Union | EU | E.U."</code>
    will search for any of the three. This can be repeated for an arbitrary
    number of words and phrases.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Inflections of words
  </h3>
  <p>
    A topic can have words with many inflected forms. The simplest case is
    when words are singular or plural. To search for all inflected forms of
    a word without specifying them manually, surround the word with
    <code>[...]</code> brackets. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text}}="[truck]"</code> will find instances of
    truck, trucks, and trucking. If multiple words are surrounded by
    <code>[...]</code>, then inflections will be found for any of the words.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Windowing around mentions
  </h3>
  <p>
    By default, <code>{{ search_keys.text}}</code> will precisely find
    the intervals of time where a word or phrase is spoken. This means that
    each mention will count for the few hundred milliseconds when the phrase
    is uttered. For analyzing topic coverage, set the
    <code>{{ search_keys.text_window }}</code> to a larger value to dilate
    a window around each mention of the phrases. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text }}="immigration" AND {{ search_keys.text_window }}=30</code>
    will find video intervals starting and ending 30 seconds before and after
    each mention of the word immigration.
