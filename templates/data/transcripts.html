  <h1>
    Searching the transcripts
  </h1>
  <p>
    Most of the videos in the dataset feature text transcripts. Transcripts are  
    time aligned to the audio track at word granularity. You can
    search for video segments where the transcript indicates a word is spoken with the predicate:
    <code>{{ search_keys.text }}="..."</code>. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text }}="United Kingdom"</code> will find all
    segments in the video collection where the phrase "United Kingdom" is spoken.
    In its basic usage,
    the <code>{{ search_keys.text }}</code> filter accepts
    individual words and phrases, where a phrase is defined as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram" target="_blank">n-gram</a>
    where all the words must appear in a sequence.  When performing queries with transcript-based filters, users should keep in
    mind that all queries compute the amount of screen time matching the query.  For a transcript query, this is the 
    screen time during which the word is being spoken.  Transcript queries do not return a count of the number of times a word appears
    in video transcripts.

  <p>
    This page describes additional features of the transcript query
    language.

  <h3>
    Listing words and phrases (word A or word B)
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes a topic can be defined with multiple related or synonymous
    words/phrases. For example, the "European Union" can be also be referred to
    as the EU or E.U. in the transcripts. When this is the case, use the "|"
    character to delimit multiple words and phrases. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text}}="European Union | EU | E.U."</code>
    will search for video segments where any of these three n-grams appear in the transcript.
    This can be repeated for an arbitrary
    number of words and phrases.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Inflections of words
  </h3>
  <p>
    Words can be used in many inflected forms. The simplest case is
    when words are singular or plural. To search for all inflected forms of
    a word without specifying them manually, surround the word with
    <code>[...]</code> brackets. For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text}}="[truck]"</code> will find instances of
    "truck", "trucks", and "trucking". If multiple words are surrounded by
    <code>[...]</code>, then inflections will be found for any of the words in the brackets.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Time windowing around mentions
  </h3>
  <p>
    By default, <code>{{ search_keys.text}}</code> will precisely find
    the intervals of time during which a word or phrase is spoken. This means that
    each mention will likely contribute only a small fraction of a second of screen time to a query result. 
    Sometimes it is useful for a transcript query to match a wider region of time around the utterance
    of a word, for example if an query seeks examples where a person is on-screen within a specific amount of time
    of a word being stated.  The 
    <code>{{ search_keys.text_window }}</code> parameter defines how much a time of time is dilated around a
    transcript match. (By default, its value is 0.) 
    For example,
    <code>{{ search_keys.text }}="immigration" AND {{ search_keys.text_window }}=30</code>
    will find video intervals starting and ending 30 seconds before and after
    each mention of the word immigration.
